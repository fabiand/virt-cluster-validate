## Objectives

* Fast, timeboxed 3min
* User understandable
* Easy to extend
* For arbitrary clusters
* Run with cluster-reader permissions

## Why not tier1/2?

They are great candidates!
However, testsuites often have expectations on the environment, thus are not easy to run in arbitrary clusters.
Testsuites also usually have a long run time.

However, with some work, testsuites can be consumed in this tool to prvide checks if they meet the tools requirements.

## Open items

- Improve debuggability
- Allow checks to be run locally
- Fetch `virtctl` and `oc` from the env
- Decouple plugin building and running them

## Extending

Just drop a new dir and check into `checks.d/plugin-*` or create a new plugin if it's a different project, product, or vendor.

## Usage

First you have to build the containerized plugins:

```console
$ dnf install -y podman  # podman is required
$ bash build-plugins.sh
# BUILDING plugin-10-openshift.d/
...
pong from plugin-10-openshift
pong from OpenShift Virtualization
$ 
```

Now you can run the checks:

> [!NOTE]
> `oc` and `virtctl` are expected to be in your `PATH`.

```console
$ oc login â€¦  # Login
$ oc project my-test-project  # Switch to the project where the testing can be performed

$ rm -rf results.d/*  # Cleanup any previous results
$ virt-cluster-validate
# Starting validation ...
# Dispatching 'quay.io/virt-cluster-validate/plugin-10-openshift:latest' ...
# Dispatching 'quay.io/virt-cluster-validate/plugin-50-openshift-virtualization:latest' ...
# Waiting for jobs to complete
# All jobs completed.
